# Classifications

### 1. Fake News Classifier

- The Fake News Classifier is a machine learning-based system designed to detect and classify news articles as either real or fake. Given the rise of misinformation, this classifier helps in identifying misleading news articles by analyzing their textual content using machine learning techniques.
- Used Multinomial Naive Bayes and logistic regression. Predicted with the best accuracy is 93.57%.
- This Fake News Classifier provides a robust solution for combating misinformation by leveraging machine learning techniques. It can be integrated into media platforms or browser extensions to flag potentially misleading content, promoting responsible news consumption.

### 2. Movie Genre Classification with Multi-label Output

- Movie Genre Classification is a multi-label classification problem where a movie can belong to multiple genres simultaneously (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama). The goal of this project is to predict the appropriate genres for a given movie based on textual metadata such as its title, synopsis, or cast information using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
- This multi-label movie genre classification model provides an effective way to categorize films based on their descriptions. It can be integrated into streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, or IMDb to enhance content recommendations and search functionalities.

### 3. Stock Sentiment Analysis-DOW JONES

- Stock Sentiment Analysis involves analyzing financial news, tweets, and market reports to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral toward specific stocks or market indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The goal is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to predict market trends based on sentiment signals.
- Used Random Forest CLassifier, Logistic Regression , Multinomial Naive Bayes and predicted the output.
- The Stock Sentiment Analysis for Dow Jones successfully demonstrated the impact of financial news sentiment on market trends. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models, the project effectively classified sentiment from various sources, including news articles, tweets, and financial reports.

### 4. Spam SMS Classification

- Spam SMS Classification is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that involves distinguishing between spam (unwanted messages) and ham (legitimate messages). The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically detect and filter out spam messages to improve user experience and security.
- Used Multinomial Naive Bayes and Decision Tree model and Random Forest model and predicted with an accuracy of 98%.
- The Spam SMS Classification project effectively demonstrated the power of machine learning in filtering unwanted messages with high accuracy. By leveraging text preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods like TF-IDF, and various classification models such as Na√Øve Bayes, Decision tree, and Random Forest, the system successfully distinguished between spam and legitimate messages. The results showed that Random Forest achieved around 98% accuracy, making it a lightweight yet highly effective model for real-world deployment. This classification system can be integrated into messaging platforms to enhance user experience, reduce spam exposure, and improve security.

 ### Future Improvements
 
 Future improvements could focus on real-time detection, advanced deep learning models like BERT, and integration with mobile applications to further refine spam detection and prevent phishing attacks and much more for the above models.
